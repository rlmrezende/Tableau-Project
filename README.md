# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
For my project, I chose to work with the FIFA 2018 Player Ratings dataset. The goal of my project is to explore and analyze the player ratings data to gain insights into the performance, value, wage and characteristics of FIFA players by country and club.

## Process
### 1. Imported the fif18_clean.csv dataset into Tableau.
### 2. Analyzed and gained an understanding of the dataset.
### 3. Created multiple worksheets with graphs and visualizations to compare different aspects of the dataset, such as player attributes, club market values, salary expenses, and player nationalities.
### 4. Combined the worksheets into a dashboard, organizing and arranging them to provide a comprehensive view of the data.
### 5. Created a story using the dashboards, sequencing them in a logical manner, and highlighting key insights and trends.

## Results
I chose Option 2 for my project, working with the FIFA2018 Player Ratings dataset. My data questions were as follows: "Which countries have the most players?" "Which country has the highest number of young players with potential?" "What are the clubs with the highest market values and salaries?" "Which clubs have the highest overall and potential ratings?" "Who are the best players based on overall rating, wage, and value?" "Are there any outliers in terms of wage and value?"

Through my visualizations, I discovered interesting patterns and trends in the data. England emerged as the country with the most players and also displayed a high number of young players with great potential. FC Bayern ranked second in terms of market value but only fifth in terms of salary expenses, suggesting they have successfully managed to acquire talented players without incurring excessive salaries. Juventus ranked seventh in market value and sixth in salary expenses, but ranked second in overall player ratings and fourth in potential player ratings, indicating a strong and well-rounded team with relatively lower expenditures. Overall rating and value were found to be the most important factors in determining player performance and market value. Additionally, attributes such as dribbling and finishing demonstrated strong correlations with player ratings


## Challenges 
My challenges were preparing the data to be clearly understood in the presentation, while trying to maintain a clean and organized project for easy and clear interpretation. Additionally, selecting the types of graphs and colors to be used in order to avoid information overload or confusion. After that, bringing everything together in dashboards and creating a cohesive story for the presentation.

## Future Goals
My future goals for the project would involve improving the dashboard design and interactivity to ensure a user-friendly experience for viewers. This would include enhancing the visual aesthetics, incorporating interactive features like filters, and allowing viewers to delve deeper into the data. Additionally, I would consider expanding the analysis by comparing player performance across different FIFA editions or exploring player performance in specific tournaments. By incorporating additional data sources, I aim to provide more comprehensive insights into the fascinating world of football.
